**Breast Cancer Prediction**

**Introduction:**

This project aims to develop a breast cancer detection system using machine learning techniques. Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and survival. With the advancements in machine learning algorithms and the availability of large datasets, it is possible to build accurate models for breast cancer detection.

**Features:**

- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for breast cancer detection.
- Provides predictions based on input data such as patient demographics and medical features.
- Offers the potential to assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib or Seaborn (for data visualization)

**Usage:**

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/xxxchall-17/breast_cancer_detection.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd breast_cancer_detection
   ```

4. Run the main script:

   ```
   python breast_cancer_detection.py
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to input patient data and obtain predictions.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used for training and testing the models is the Breast Cancer dataset, which is publicly available through the Kaggley. Features are computed for each cell nucleus, and the target variable indicates whether the mass is benign or malignant.

**Models:**

Several machine learning algorithms are implemented for breast cancer detection, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines

**Evaluation:**

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure robustness of the models.
